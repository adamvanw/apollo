CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Users/adamv/AppData/Local/Programs/CLion Nova/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.29/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (webp) does
  not match the name of the calling package (WebP).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
